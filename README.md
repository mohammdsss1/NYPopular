## The used architecture is **MVVM**.

#### The App has two targets:
1. Main App target, which contains a unit test file to test the model view.
2. a framework target called **Networking** to handle backend communications. It has a unit test file to test its major function.

To build the App just run the following command: 
`fastlane gym --export_method development`

To run the tests, just do:
`fastlane tests`
